## Worksheet 7 ##
**Question 1:**
Packets are smaller tiny pieces of information that travel across routes through networks - they consist of headers and a payload. The headers store addresses of where to send the packet 
while the payload stores the data.

**Question 2:**
The internet layer actually inter-connects the networks. It provides a routing for the packets in other words. In order to interact with it, you need to specify the IP Address of the 
wanted computer  

**Question 3:**
Say that there are two processes running on two different computers on the internet. The transport layer will provide an abstraction which will make those processes seem as if they are interacting with
each other.

**Question 4:**
SMTP is used to send or recieve emails while HTTP is used for accessing web content.  

**Question 5:**
Domain names are human readable alias for the bytes which are IP Addresses. Domains can be mapped to IP addresses.

**Question 6:**
Individual ports can be accessed to allow internet traffic to go to specific applications or areas. The operating system direct the traffic inside of the computer.  

**Question 7:**
```Java
MAIN METHOD()

  Socket sock = null;
  try{
    sock = new Socket("123.45.678.900", 4040);
  }catch(Exception e){
    System.err.println("Cannot Convert");
    System.exit(1);
  }

  try{
      Socket socket = new Socket("123.45.678.900", 4040);
      PrintWriter x = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());
      x.println("red");
      x.close();
      sock.close();
  } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.print("IOException");
      System.exit(1);
  }
}

```  

**Question 8:**
A socket input stream is used to recieve information while a socket output stream is used to write/send information.  

**Question 9:**

The socketServer wait until someone opens a connection - so in other words it accepts connections from sockets. Only the serverSocket has this accept method to be
able to accept as many sockets as possible. The server handles sockets while the socket makes the client.  

**Question 10:**
Threaded sockets are useful with servers because new threads can be started instead of just 1 waiting to accept sockets. If there is only 1, everything else would have
to wait for one singular process to complete. With threads, this process is allowed to occur while other threads accept sockets. The server manages to keep listening by having multiple threads
executing processes while having main still be open to new connections.
